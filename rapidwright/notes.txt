- Install RapidWright from [RapidWright repository](https://github.com/Xilinx/RapidWright/).
The spades repository is set up such that rapidwright/ points to RapidWright source repository
(e.g., as a submodule). You can copy the RapidWright source here or create a symlink to achieve this.

- Copy spades/rapidwright/spades to {RapidWright_repo}/src/com/xilinx/rapidwright/

- Apply the git patch as follows

git apply patch edifnetlist.patch

to update {RapidWright_repo}/src/com/xilinx/rapidwright/edif/EDIFNetlist.java
with some methods required by the flow.

- spades/rapidwright/spades_config contains several JSON config file examples
for the SPADES flow. A SPADES JSON config file describes how many sockets are
required for design assembly as well as their NoC connectivity.

- Available commands

./run_rw.sh FFBridgeExtract: extract ff_bridge cells implemented in spades/checkpoints/socket_cc.dcp.

./run_rw.sh SocketStitch: combine Socket CC checkpoint (spades/checkpoints/socket_cc.dcp) and Socket CL checkpoint (spades/checkpoints/socket_rg_cl.dcp).

./run_rw.sh SpadesFlow spades_config/9_socket_m.json: assemble 9 sockets to produce a full design checkpoint (spades/checkpoints/full_design.dcp)
